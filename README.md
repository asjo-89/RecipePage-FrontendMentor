## My process
- I started to add the basic elements in the index.html to get everything in the right order. 
- Made basic styling for root variables, body and fonts. 
- Add design styling to match the provided design sheet.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I've been practicing mainly respinsive design in this assignment. In the process I encountered a problem to make the different lists behave as I wanted but eventually I solved the issue by adding a <p> around the content in every <li>.

### Continued development

In future projects I'm going to focus on mobile-first developement.
